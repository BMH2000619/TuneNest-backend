### **_Description_**

TuneNest is a full-stack web application that lets users create, manage, and share music playlists. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the app allows users to add songs (manually or via embed links), organize them into custom playlists, and explore public playlists created by others. Features include user authentication, playlist liking, and a clean, responsive UI.

### **_Technologies Used_**

- JavaScript
- React
- Express
- Mongodb
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- CSS

### **_Getting Started_**

I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/IIPnZzpk/tunenest) to design my User Scenarios, and [LucidCharts](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ca74c74a-23fb-47fa-a5af-8e18dd6b90f1/edit?viewport_loc=-341%2C-509%2C2058%2C1415%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_87ed71a4-4ac7-4661-baed-3540f5df1886) to plan my ERD's and Schemas of the project of TuneNest.
